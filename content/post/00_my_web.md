## I want a website

I wanted to have my own personal website for a long time. I have tried to create a website many times. I tried to have my own website on 000webhostapp, hostinger and gihub with HTML and CSS, but these designs are usually so simple and unsatisfied for me.

## Now I really want to build a new one!

I am building this website with Hugo. This is a new way for me to build a website. I thought it was so hard to learn, or I should say I preferred to use HTML and CSS before. But now I have changed my mind. I found Hugo to be so powerful and beautiful! Haha! This is my personal website and I think I will be hosting it for n years.

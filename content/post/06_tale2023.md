## Go to Auckland

One of my conference papers has been accepted by TALE2023. This conference was held in Auckland from 28-Nov to 1-Dec. This is the first time I can attend a conference in person.

Accepted paper: Exploring the Factors and Moderators Influencing the Use of Radar Visualisation of Student Performance from Parentsâ€™ Perspective

## Attending the Conference
I attended the workshop session, keynote and other presentations, and my presentation was scheduled for the last day. Thank you all for coming to my presentation. I hope my research has given you some insights.

TALE2023 provides me an opportunity to communicate with other researchers and learn from them. It is a valuable experience to brand my horizontal and realise the state-of-the-art research in my field.

Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity.
